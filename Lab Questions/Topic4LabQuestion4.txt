The Linux 3 level page table structure consists of table types including a page directory, a page middle directory, and a regular page table. For each active process there is a single page directory that is the size of one page. Each entry in this page directory table points to one page of the middle directory. This page directory table must be in main memory. The page middle directory, unlike the page directory can span multiple pages. However like the page directory, each entry here points to one page in the page table. The page table can also span multiple pages, each page here though refers to one virtual page of the active process. In order to use the 3 level page table structure, virtual addresses must consist of a global directory which is an index into the page directory, the middle directory which is an index into the page middle directory, the third is an index into the page table and the fourth is the offset for the given page.
